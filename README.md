# quantlab

A personal research repository exploring **quantitative finance**, **model risk**, and **machine learning for derivatives pricing and hedging**.

> 🔍 **Note**: This project is *unrelated* to [QuantLib.org](https://www.quantlib.org/). It is a private learning and experimentation space by [AlmostAnna](https://github.com/AlmostAnna).

## What’s Inside

This repo contains:
- **Classical models**: Black-Scholes, Heston, local volatility
- **Exotic derivatives**: Autocallables, Asian options, structured notes
- **Hedging analysis**: Error decomposition, stop-loss replication, discrete trading
- **Machine learning**: Buehler-style deep hedging with transaction costs
- **Stress testing**: Sensitivity to volatility misspecification, rebalancing frequency

All code is organized to support **reuse**, **clarity**, and **diagnostics**—not just one-off experiments.

## Getting Started

1. Clone and install:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlmostAnna/quantlab.git
   cd quantlab
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

## Philosophy

- Clarity over cleverness: Code should speak for itself.
- Model risk matters: Every assumption is surfaced and tested.
- ML as a tool, not a black box: Diagnostics, baselines, and stress tests are first-class citizens.
